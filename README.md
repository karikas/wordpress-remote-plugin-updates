# wordpress-remote-plugin-updates
Provide updates for WordPress plugins that are stored outside of the WordPress Plugins Directory.  By setting up the server at a URL and uploading zip file packages of each version of your plugin, WordPress sites using your plugin will automatically prompt for updates and display plugin information, including graphics like banners and screenshots when applicable.
